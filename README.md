# Predicting malignant versus benign breast cancer cases
Predicting the probability that a diagnosed breast cancer case is malignant or benign based on Wisconsin dataset from UCI repository. 

## Libraries used
numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.pipeline, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.naive_bayes, scipy

# Uses
This project tests various classifiers (logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, random forest, and others) to find the classifier that predicts the testing data with the best possible accuracy at the shortest time possible.  

First, it examines the data looking for patterns of correlations among variables. Then it runs various classifiers and compare them. Once a number of 2-3 classifiers is identified as most accurate, the model is fine tuned again. Then, we can see which model predicts data with the highest accuracy.
